## Main Components of a Cell
- Cell membrane: Controls what enters and leaves the cell
- Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance where chemical reactions occur
- Nucleus: Contains genetic material and controls cell activities

## Plant vs Animal Cells
| Feature | Plant Cells | Animal Cells |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Cell Wall | Present | Absent |
| Chloroplasts | Present | Absent |
| Vacuoles | Large, central | Small, multiple |
| Shape | Regular, rectangular | Irregular |

### Key Processes
1. **Diffusion**: Movement of substances from high to low concentration
2. **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane
3. **Active Transport**: Movement of substances against concentration gradient (requires energy)

*Next class: We will look at cell division and reproduction.*`

    content: `# Cell Division and Reproduction

## Mitosis
Cell division process that results in two identical daughter cells
- Important for growth and tissue repair
- Steps: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, Cytokinesis

## Meiosis
- Specialized cell division that creates gametes (sperm and egg cells)
- Reduces chromosome number by half
- Introduces genetic variation through crossing over
- Results in four haploid daughter cells

## Comparison
Mitosis: 
- 1 division
- 2 identical diploid cells
- Body cells (somatic)

Meiosis:
- 2 divisions
- 4 different haploid cells
- Reproductive cells

### Practical Examples
- Skin regeneration (mitosis)
- Sperm production (meiosis)
- Plant propagation (mitosis)

    content: `# Genetics and Heredity

## Mendel's Laws
1. **Law of Segregation**: Each individual has two alleles for each trait, and these separate during gamete formation
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: Genes for different traits are inherited independently
3. **Law of Dominance**: Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive

## Punnett Squares
Used to predict the probability of specific traits in offspring.

Example: 
- Tt Ã— Tt cross (T=tall, t=short)
- Possible outcomes: TT, Tt, tT, tt
- Phenotype ratio: 3:1 (tall:short)

## Human Genetic Disorders
- **Down Syndrome**: Trisomy of chromosome 21
- **Cystic Fibrosis**: Recessive disorder affecting mucus production
- **Huntington's Disease**: Dominant disorder affecting nervous system

### Modern Applications
- Genetic counseling
- Gene therapy
- CRISPR technology

*Questions for next class: How do environmental factors influence gene expression?*`
